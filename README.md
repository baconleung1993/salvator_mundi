# Salvator Mundi Project
This repository contain 3D models, textures, scene setup, codes that have been used to generate renderings in two _Salvator Mundi_ papers:

***On the Optical Accuracy of the Salvator Mundi*** [[intro](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~zhanhanl/web_files/projects/salvator_mundi/salvator_mundi_hollowness.md.html)]

***Inverse-Rendering Based Analysis of the Fine Illumination Effects in the Salvator Mundi*** [[intro](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~zhanhanl/web_files/projects/salvator_mundi/salvator_mundi.md.html)]
## Mitsuba Render
We used Mitsuba 0.5.0 for the rendering. 
[Mitsuba 0.5.0](http://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/index_old.html)

Output results are HDR files. You can use following software to view HDR files:
